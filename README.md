# A study on Review Classes and Exam Scores

## Description

Given a pre-announced date for an exam, students are offered the following study options in order to help them prepare for an exam:<br>
a. 10 study sessions (B1)<br>
b. 5 study sessions (B2)<br>
Students can also opt to study on their own and not join the study sessions (Control).

Ten study sessions will be able to cover all the topics for the exam. Five study sessions will be able to cover approximately half of the topics in the exam. (It is expected that the student will be self-studying the topics that will not be covered by the 5 sessions.) The study sessions also include assessments at the end of each lesson so the students can know what area/s they need to improve on.
