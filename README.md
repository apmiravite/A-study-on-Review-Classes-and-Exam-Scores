# A study on Review Classes and Exam Scores

## Description

Given a pre-announced date for an exam, students are offered the following study options in order to help them prepare for an exam:<br>
a. 10 study sessions (B1)<br>
b. 5 study sessions (B2)<br>
Students can also opt to study on their own and not join the study sessions.

Ten study sessions will be able to cover all the topics for the exam. Five study sessions will be able to cover approximately half of the topics in the exam. (It is expected that the student will be self-studying the topics that will not be covered by the 5 sessions.) The study sessions also include assessments at the end of each lesson so the students can know what area/s they need to improve on.

We want to see if the study sessions has an effect on the test scores of the participants.

## Data

The original dataset has five columns.
1. Treatment: whether the student attended the 10-session (b1)/ 5-session (b2) review class or studied on their own.
2. Student code: A unique identifier for a student, consists of a combination of the age group and treatment code and a random 3-digit number at the end.
3. Age group of the student
4. Gender of the student
5. Exam score: Student's score in the exam (the perfect score is 40)
